## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. All the pull requests are made against `master` branch.

2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.

## Coding conventions

- Read and pay attention to current code in the repository
- For the Python part, we follow [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) for formating code. Once you're ready to commit changes, format your code with `black` and check your code with `flake8`.
- And always remember the Zen of Python.

## Getting up and running

Minimum requirements: **pip, python3.7**, setup is tested on Linux Ubuntu 20.04 only.

## Golden Rule:

> Anything in **master** is always **deployable**.
